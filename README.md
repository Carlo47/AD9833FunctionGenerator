# AD9833FunctionGenerator
Yeat another AD9833 Function Generator

This project shows the use of an AD9833 breakout bord as DDS function generator.
Output frequency and waveform are set on AD9833
Output amplitude is controlled by means of the digital potentiometer MCP41010
which controls the OPAMP AD8051 in 255 steps
AD9833 and MCP41010 have SPI interface
